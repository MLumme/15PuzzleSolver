Week 5 report
=============

Work done
---------

* Implemented Iterative Deepening Depth First Search as an alternative to IDA*, usable in smaller puzzles, due to its similarity to compare the effect of the heuristic in IDA*.
* Put together a generator for creating random puzzles of given size and given number of steps from endstate, tied it together with UI, still neds some modifications as deth is not currently asced in UI.
* Added commentary to existing tests to make clearer what they do.
* Started working on  testing and implementation documentation.
* Not exactly work for this project, but did the testing and writing for the peer code review.

Next week
---------
* Need to make a small command line program for easier performance testing, as GUI is not really suitable for processing a large number of puzzles and timing them.
* Continuing above, performance testing.
* Testing for Solver- and PuzzleGen-classes.
* Continued work on documentation, user manual still AWOL.
