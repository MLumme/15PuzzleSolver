Week 1 report
=============

Work done
---------
* Most of actual work on project has been on reading on the theoretical side of A* and its use in n-puzzles
* Project creation
* Repository creation
* Way too much time spent on deciding the subject of the project
* Absolutely no coding done this week

Problems
--------
None so far, exluding slight uncertainty of Javas suitabilty for the project due to its less than stellar performance.

Next week
---------
* Implementation of A* using premade datastructures, hopefully some testing for it on small n-puzzles.
* Implementation of classes for board states, including f and g-values
* Function to compute Manhattan distance heuristic
